# Any-Sync File Node
Implementation of file node from [`any-sync`](https://github.com/anyproto/any-sync) protocol.

## Building the source
To build and run the Any-Sync File Node on your own server, follow these technical steps:

1.  Clone the Any-Sync File Node repository to your local machine.
2.  Navigate to the root directory of the repository, where you will find a `Makefile`.
3.  Run the command `make deps` to install the required dependencies for the Any-Sync File Node.*
4.  Run the command `make build` to build the Any-Sync File Node.*
5.  If there are no errors, the Any-Sync File Node will be built and can be found in the `/bin` directory.

*To avoid any Go language version incompatibility issues, please use version `1.19` of Go.

## Running
When running the Any-Sync File Node, you can use the following options:

 - `-c` Every node should be run with the configuration file option. By
   default, the option flag is set to `etc/any-sync-node.yml.` You can
   always generate a new configuration using the appropriate command **???**
 - `-v` This option shows the current version of the Any-Sync Node and then exits.
 - `-h` This option shows the help message and then exits.
